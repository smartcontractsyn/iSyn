(i) Apportionment of Taxes.
In order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to any taxable year or period that includes an Interim Period (as defined in Section 1.7(i)), the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the Interim Period shall be:
(A) in the case of Taxes not described in subparagraph “(B)”, below, deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year or period ended on the Closing Date (except that, solely for purposes of determining the marginal tax rate applicable to income or receipts during such period in a jurisdiction in which such tax rate depends upon the level of income or receipts, annualized income or receipts may be taken into account, if appropriate, for an equitable sharing of such Taxes); and
(B) in the case of any property and ad valorem taxes deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Interim Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant Tax period.
(ii) Changes in GAAP.
For all purposes under this Section 1.7, “GAAP” shall mean GAAP as in effect on the date of the Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet.
Notwithstanding (A) any changes in GAAP after the date thereof, (B) any change by the Company in its application of GAAP between March 31, 2006 and the date of this Agreement, or (C) any change by the Company in its application of GAAP during the Pre-Closing Period (to the extent permitted by this Agreement), the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent the Company’s reserve for uncollectible accounts or unsaleable inventory are calculated based on a percentage of the aggregate accounts or inventory of a specified age or type, the same percentage (or in the case of inventory, the same methodology for determining the percentage) and type as was used for the purposes of calculating the amount of such reserves on the Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet shall be used to calculate the amount of such reserves on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, notwithstanding any change in the manner in which such reserves were calculated after the date of the Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet.
(iii) Gross Property, Plant and Equipment.
Gross Property, Plant and Equipment shall not be decreased or increased from the amount of Gross Property, Plant and Equipment on the Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet as a result of any physical audit performed by Parent or the Acquired Companies after the Closing or otherwise, except as a result of any capital expenditures made by the Company after March 31, 2006 (including any such decrease as a result of a determination that property, plant or equipment reflected in the Company’s books and records or financial statements and not currently used in the business as currently conducted is no longer used by or in the possession of, the Company).
The Stockholders’ Representative shall include in the Objection Notice a reasonably detailed calculation of the Post-Closing Surplus Amount or Post-Closing Deficit Amount as determined by the Stockholders’ Representative (the “Stockholders’ Representative Proposed Adjustment”), accompanied by a reasonably detailed description of the bases for any variances between the Parent Proposed Adjustment and the Stockholders’ Representative Proposed Adjustment (the “Description of Variances”).
(h) If at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, the parties have not reached an agreement on the Stockholders’ Representative’s objections set forth in any valid Objection Notice, then all amounts and issues remaining in dispute may, at the election of either party, be submitted by the Stockholders’ Representative or Parent to Deloitte & Touche or another mutually agreeable nationally recognized firm of independent auditors that has not performed work for (other than as a neutral auditor), and is otherwise independent of, each of Parent, the Company, the Stockholders’ Representative and any Escrow Participant who owns greater than a 10% interest in the Working Capital Adjustment Escrow Fund (the “Neutral Auditor”).
All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Auditor shall be allocated to Parent, on the one hand, and the Escrow Participants, on the other hand, with amounts owed by the Escrow Participants to be withdrawn first from the Working Capital Adjustment Escrow Fund and, to the extent the Working Capital Adjustment Escrow Fund is insufficient to cover such expenses, then from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, in the same proportion that the amount of disputed items so submitted to the Neutral Auditor that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by the Neutral Auditor) bears to the total amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted.
Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs and expenses incurred by the parties in connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Neutral Auditor shall be borne by the party incurring such cost and expense.
The Neutral Auditor shall act as an arbitrator to determine only those issues still in dispute at the time of the election by either party to submit the objections to the Neutral Auditor, which shall be limited to whether the Closing Date Balance Sheet was prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in Section 1.7(f) and whether and to what extent (if any) there should be an adjustment to the aggregate consideration payable in connection with the Merger in accordance with Section 1.7(d).

Subject to Section 5.8(b), the Company and Parent shall: (a) respond as promptly as practicable to: (i) any inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice for additional information or documentation; and (ii) any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust authority or other Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or related matters; (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to take all other actions necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the Antitrust Laws as soon as practicable; and (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any objections which may be asserted by any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger under the Antitrust Laws.
Subject to Section 5.8(b), in the event any Legal Proceeding is threatened or instituted by any Governmental Body challenging the Merger as violative of Antitrust Laws, each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the institution of, or to resist or resolve, such Legal Proceeding.
At the request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action relating to the business, product lines or assets of any Acquired Company, provided that any such action is: (A) determined by Parent in good faith to facilitate compliance with any Legal Requirement or any request by any Governmental Body; and (B) conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.
5.2 Written Consents; Information Statement.
The Information Statement shall include, subject to the fiduciary duties of the board of directors of the Company, a statement to the effect that the board of directors of the Company recommends that the Company’s stockholders that have not been deemed to have executed Written Consents approving the Merger, adopt this Agreement and approve the Certificate Amendment.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing shall in any way limit the right of Parent and its board of directors to comply with its obligations under the Exchange Act or other applicable Legal Requirements; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not be construed as granting to Parent any right to terminate this Agreement other than in accordance with the terms of Section 8.
During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent shall not and shall not permit its Representatives to: (i) enter into any letter of intent, term sheet or definitive acquisition or merger agreement with any Person contemplating a possible Business Combination or Tack-On Transaction; (ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations concerning any letter of intent, term sheet or definitive acquisition or merger agreement contemplating a Business Combination or Tack-On Transaction; or (iii) engage in any substantive due diligence review of non-public information of any Person in contemplation of a Business Combination or Tack-On Transaction.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.5, during the Pre-Closing Period, Parent may do any one or more of the following: (w) engage in discussions or negotiations and enter into any letter of intent or term sheet with any Person contemplating any Eligible Tack-On Transaction if such action would not require that the Proxy Statement be amended or supplemented to describe such Eligible Tack-On Transaction, (x) upon the Company’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, engage in discussions or negotiations and enter into any letter of intent or term sheet with any Person contemplating any Eligible Tack-On Transaction if such action would require that the Proxy Statement be amended or supplemented to describe such Eligible Tack-On Transaction, (y) upon the Company’s prior written consent, which may be withheld or conditioned in the Company’s sole discretion, engage in discussions or negotiations and enter into any letter of intent or term sheet with any Person contemplating any Tack-On Transaction that is not an Eligible Tack-On Transaction, and (z) upon the Company’s prior written consent, which may be withheld or conditioned in the Company’s sole discretion, enter into any definitive acquisition or merger agreement with any Person contemplating any Tack-On Transaction.
As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall submit to the stockholders of the Company (in a manner satisfactory to Parent) for approval by such number of stockholders of the Company as is required by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code a written consent in favor of a single proposal to render the parachute payment provisions of Section 280G of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (collectively, “Section 280G”) inapplicable to any and all payments and/or benefits provided pursuant to Acquired Company Employee Plans, Acquired Company Employee Agreements or other Acquired Company Contracts (including payments pursuant to the Severance Agreements or any employee bonus plan adopted in connection with the Contemplated Transactions) that might result, separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any amount and/or the provision of any benefit that would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G or that would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code (together, the “Section 280G Payments”).
Any such stockholder approval shall be obtained in a manner which satisfies all applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, including Q-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of such Treasury Regulations.
The form and substance of all stockholder approval documents contemplated by this Section 5.6, including the waivers, shall be subject to the review and approval of Parent.

Except as required by applicable Legal Requirements and in the case of Parent, except for any filings required to be made with the SEC or other actions that Parent in good faith deems to be necessary or appropriate in connection with seeking to obtain the Required Parent Merger Stockholder Vote (including in connection with the Proxy Statement), during the Pre-Closing Period, Parent and the Company shall not (and the Company shall not permit any of the Acquired Companies or any Representative of any of the Acquired Companies to) issue any press release or make any public statement regarding this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions without the prior written consent of the other party; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.7 shall preclude (i) the Company from complying with its obligation under Section 228 of the DGCL to notify those of its stockholders who did not execute Written Consents of the adoption of this Agreement by the Written Consents executed by the Key Stockholders, (ii) the board of directors of the Company from exercising its fiduciary duties in communications with stockholders of the Company or (iii) the board of directors of Parent from exercising its fiduciary duties in communications with stockholders of Parent.
5.8 Additional Agreements.
(a) Subject to Section 5.8(b), Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to consummate the Merger and make effective the other Contemplated Transactions.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to Section 5.8(b), each party to this Agreement (i) shall make all filings (if any) and give all notices (if any) required to be made and given by such party in connection with the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, and (ii) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Legal Requirement or Acquired Company Contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent shall not have any obligation under this Agreement or otherwise: (i) to dispose of or transfer any assets, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to dispose of or transfer any assets; (ii) to discontinue offering any product or service, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to discontinue offering any product or service; (iii) to license or otherwise make available to any Person, any technology, software or other Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to license or otherwise make available to any Person any technology, software or other Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right; (iv) to hold separate any assets or operations (either before or after the Closing Date), or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Companies to hold separate any assets or operations; or (v) to make any commitment (to any Governmental Body or otherwise) regarding its future operations or the future operations of any of the Acquired Companies.
5.9 Financing.
(a) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange and consummate the transactions contemplated by the Wachovia Commitment Letter and such additional debt and/or equity financing transactions (collectively, the “Financing Transactions” and the Wachovia Commitment Letter together with any commitment letter or any similar agreement with respect to the Financing Transactions, the “Financing Commitments”) such that, at the Closing, Parent would have sufficient funds available to pay all amounts payable at or promptly following the Closing by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Sections 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 and all of the related fees and expenses payable by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Merger and other Contemplated Transactions.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts: (i) to the extent within its control, to satisfy all conditions precedent in any Financing Commitments then in effect and in any definitive agreements relating to the Financing Transactions, (ii) to negotiate in good faith definitive agreements respecting the Financing Transactions, and (iii) if any material portion of the financing to be provided at the Closing contemplated by the Wachovia Financing Letter has become unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, to obtain alternative financing from the same or other sources subject to substantially similar conditions precedent to funding to those set forth in the Wachovia Commitment Letter.
Parent shall not permit any material amendment or modification to be made to the conditions precedent to funding or any other material provision set forth in the Wachovia Financing Commitment (or any other Financing Commitment entered into after the date hereof that replaces the Wachovia Financing Commitment) that could reasonably result in a material reduction in the amount of financing available at the Closing thereunder without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld).
In the event that any Stockholder Loan is made in connection with the Closing, Parent shall not enter into any other Financing Transaction at the Closing or, so long as any Stockholder Loan remains outstanding, incur any indebtedness that does not permit any Stockholder Loan to be refinanced by Parent and its Subsidiaries with the proceeds of any equity financing or any debt financing on terms that, in the aggregate, are not worse for the Parent and its other lenders than the terms of the Stockholder Loan being refinanced.
(d) If requested by the Company at any time after the earlier of January 10, 2007 or the date of the filing of the definitive Proxy Statement by Parent in the event Parent has not negotiated definitive agreements with respect to Financing Transactions as a result of which it reasonably expects to receive at least $115 million in proceeds at the Closing, or by Parent at any time, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall negotiate definitive agreements with respect to the Stockholder Loans and Parent shall reimburse the Stockholder Representative for any out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable out-of-pocket legal fees in connection therewith) incurred by the Stockholder Representative in negotiating such agreements.
If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are unable to agree on any terms or conditions of the Stockholder Loans not specified above, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly retain (at Parent’s sole cost and expense) a mutually acceptable nationally recognized law firm with experience representing lenders in loans of the types included in the Stockholder Loan, which shall resolve any dispute regarding such terms and conditions by determining the prevailing market practice then in effect with respect to loans of such type (it being understood that, except as noted in Section 5.9(c), such loans are not being made on terms customary for seller financing and are instead intended to be made on market terms typical for loans of such type made by commercial lenders).
In the event that, and at such time as, any Parent Indemnitee would otherwise have become entitled to receive a distribution out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 9.7 (a “Distribution Entitlement”), the indemnity obligation of the Escrow Participants, and such Parent Indemnitee’s entitlement to such distribution, shall be satisfied first by reducing the principal amount of the Stockholder Term B Loan dollar-for-dollar by the amount of such Distribution Entitlement, up to the lesser of (x) the principal amount of the Stockholder Term B Loan then remaining outstanding or (y) the amount of such Distribution Entitlement, and any remaining portion of such Distribution Entitlement shall be satisfied by reducing the principal amount of the Stockholder Mezzanine Loan dollar-for-dollar by the remaining amount of such Distribution Entitlement, up to the lesser of (1) the principal amount of the Stockholder Mezzanine Loan then remaining outstanding or (2) the remaining amount of such Distribution Entitlement.
(f) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts (at Parent’s sole cost and expense with respect to any out-of-pocket expenses requested to be incurred by Parent in connection therewith) to assist Parent in connection with transactions undertaken by Parent to finance the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any of the Acquired Companies be required to enter into any agreement or incur any liability or obligation with respect to such financing transactions prior to the Closing.
5.13 Resignation of Officers and Directors.
5.14 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.
(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of each current and former officer and director of the Acquired Companies (the “D&O Indemnified Persons”) as provided in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or other organization documents of the Acquired Companies (as in effect on the date of this Agreement) or the indemnification agreements identified in Part 2.10(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule (as in effect on the date of this Agreement) shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for at least six years following the Effective Time (or, in the case of a claim for indemnification asserted against an Acquired Company by a D&O Indemnified Person during such six year period, for such longer period until such claim is finally resolved), and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor such obligations to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements.
(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain or cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, for events that shall have occurred prior to the Effective Time, the existing level and scope of directors’ and officers’ liability, employee practices liability insurance and fiduciary insurance covering those D&O Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability, employee practices liability insurance and fiduciary insurance policy (collectively, the “Existing D&O Policies”), if directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage is commercially available; provided, however, that: (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing D&O Policies a policy or policies of comparable coverage; and (ii) in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year for the Existing D&O Policies (or for any substitute policies) in the aggregate, in excess of 150% of current premium (such amount being referred to as the “Maximum Premium”); and provided, further, that if the annual premiums payable for the Existing D&O Policies (or any substitute policies) exceed the Maximum Premium, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing D&O Policies (or any substitute policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal to the Maximum Premium.
The provisions of this Section 5.14(b) shall be deemed to have been satisfied if a prepaid policy has been obtained prior to the Effective Time for purposes of this Section 5.14(b), which policy provides such D&O Indemnified Persons with coverage comparable to the coverage provided by the Existing D&O Policies for an aggregate period of six years following the Effective Time (and the Company shall, at the request of Parent, obtain such a prepaid policy prior to the Effective Time, provided that the cost thereof shall be borne by Parent).
(c) The provisions of this Section 5.14 shall survive the Closing and are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each of the D&O Indemnified Persons and his or her heirs and personal representatives.
5.15 Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation.

(a) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the board of directors of Parent to consist, at or promptly following the Effective Time, of the individuals identified on Schedule 5.17(a).

5.18 Parent Trust Account.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company has read a copy of Parent’s prospectus dated March 15, 2006 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Prospectus”).
On behalf of itself and each other Acquired Company, Acquired Company Affiliate and Company Indemnitee (and affiliates thereof) (collectively, the “Company Claimants”), the Company: (a) agrees that neither it nor any Company Claimant has any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to (i) any assets in the Trust Account, (ii) assets of Parent to the extent such right, title, interest or claim would impair the amounts in the Trust Account or (iii) assets distributed from the Trust Account to the public stockholders (each such right, title, interest or claim a “Claim”); (b) unless and until Parent completes another Business Combination (as defined in Parent’s certificate of incorporation as of the date of this Agreement), hereby waives any Claim that it or any Company Claimant may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements; and (c) agrees that neither it nor any other Company Claimant will seek recourse against the Trust Account or the public stockholders of Parent (in their capacity as stockholders of Parent or as recipients of liquidating distributions from Parent) for any reason whatsoever.
Further, the Company acknowledges that it has read Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, which states in full:
“A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”
The Company, on behalf of itself and the Company Claimants, hereby waives any right that the Company or the Company Claimants have or may have under Section 1542 (or any similar provision of the laws of any other jurisdiction) to the full extent that the Company may lawfully waive such rights pertaining to this waiver of Claims and generally affirms that Company is releasing, on behalf of itself and the Company Claimants, all known and unknown Claims.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Trust Account is not a party to this Agreement and shall have no liability pursuant hereto.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, no provision contained herein shall limit the Company or the Company Indemnitees’ right to make a claim against such monies to the extent such monies are released from the Trust Account to Parent upon the consummation of the Merger.
5.19 Maintenance of Benefits.
Parent will extend to each Acquired Company Employee an offer of employment that, if accepted, would contemplate that such Acquired Company Employee would commence employment with Parent or continue employment with the Surviving Corporation effective as of the Closing Date and would provide, for one year following the Closing Date, such Acquired Company Employee with compensation, benefits and terms of employment that in the aggregate are substantially comparable to the compensation, benefits and terms of employment provided by the Company to such Acquired Company Employee as of the date of this Agreement.
To the extent such transactions are consummated at or prior to the Closing, the 7,583,501 shares of Company Class B Common Stock held of record by Conexant as of the date hereof shall be deemed not to be outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for all purposes hereunder and the holder thereof shall not be entitled to any portion of the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to the holders of Company Common Stock.

(iii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company in this Agreement, other than the covenant in Section 4.2(a)(ii);
(v) any liability of any Acquired Company for unpaid Taxes for any tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (a “Pre-Closing Tax Period”) (except to the extent such unpaid Taxes were included in the calculation of the Closing Working Capital Amount;
(vi) the Post-Closing Deficit Amount exceeding the amount remaining in the Working Capital Adjustment Escrow Fund;
(vii) the exercise by any Stockholder of such Stockholder’s appraisal rights under the DGCL to the extent any Damages as a result thereof (including any payment required to be made to such Stockholder) exceed the amount such Stockholder would otherwise be paid under Section 1.5 if such Stockholder had not exercised such Stockholder’s appraisal rights under the DGCL; and
(viii) the matters disclosed in Part 9.2(a)(viii) of the Disclosure Schedule.
Notwithstanding clause “(i)” or clause “(ii)” above (to the extent they relate to breaches of any representations or warranties in Section 2.14) or clause “(v)” above, the Parent Indemnitees shall not be indemnified pursuant to such clauses for any Damages for Taxes that are directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any of the Parent Indemnitees or to which any of the Parent Indemnitees may otherwise become directly or indirectly subject and that arise from or as a result of or are directly or indirectly connected with: (A) the acquisition of Company stock pursuant to this Agreement being treated as a sale of assets pursuant to any express or deemed election by Parent under Section 338 of the Code or comparable provisions under foreign or other Tax law; (B) any transaction that is undertaken on the Closing Date at the direction of Parent or any of its Affiliates or after the Closing Date outside the ordinary course of business; (C) any transaction of the Acquired Companies occurring after the Closing; and (D) any Tax election or Tax reporting position with a Governmental Body with respect to Taxes by a Parent Indemnitee following the Effective Time that results in an increased Tax liability or reduction in any Tax asset of the Acquired Companies in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date), unless such Tax election or Tax reporting position was required by a Governmental Body as a result of an audit or was clearly required by applicable Legal Requirements.
Notwithstanding clause “(i)” or clause “(ii)” above (to the extent they relate to breaches of any representations or warranties in Section 2.14) or clause “(v)” above, Damages arising out of the Company’s obligation to pay California sales or use Taxes for any transaction that occurred after March 31, 2005 and that remain unpaid at the Closing Date shall be deemed to be, and shall in all events be limited to, 70% of such unpaid amounts.
(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company Indemnitees from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse the Company Indemnitees for, any Damages that are directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any of the Company Indemnitees (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third party claim), and that arise from or as a result of, or are directly or indirectly connected with:
(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Parent as of the date of this Agreement, giving effect to any materiality qualification limiting the scope of such representation or warranty for purposes of determining whether such representation or warranty is inaccurate or has been breached, but without giving effect to any materiality qualification limiting the scope of such representation or warranty for purposes of calculating any Damages;
(ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Parent as of the Closing Date as if such representation and warranty had been made on and as of the Closing Date, giving effect to any materiality qualification limiting the scope of such representation or warranty for purposes of determining whether such representation or warranty is inaccurate or has been breached, but without giving effect to any materiality qualification limiting the scope of such representation or warranty for purposes of calculating any Damages; or
(iii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of Parent in this Agreement.
(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that, if the Surviving Corporation suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Damages as a result of or in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, then (without limiting any of the rights of the Surviving Corporation as a Parent Indemnitee) Parent shall also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving Corporation, to have incurred Damages as a result of and in connection with such inaccuracy or breach (it being understood that any Damages suffered or incurred by the Surviving Corporation shall be recoverable without duplication under this Section 9 by either Parent or the Surviving Corporation).
9.3 Certain Limitations.
(a) Except in the event of fraud and any intentional breach of any covenant of the Company, the Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any Damages pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i), Section 9.2(a)(ii) or Section 9.2(a)(iii) until such time as the total amount of all Damages that have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Parent Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of the Parent Indemnitees has or have otherwise become subject, and that would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to such Sections but for the application of this Section 9.3(a), exceeds $1,700,000 in the aggregate.
(b) Except in the event of fraud, any intentional breach of any covenant of Parent and any breach by Parent of any obligation to pay any amounts required to be paid pursuant to Sections 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8, the Company Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover any Damages pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(i) or Section 9.2(b)(ii) for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Parent until such time as the total amount of all Damages that have been directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Company Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of the Company Indemnitees has or have otherwise become subject, and that would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to such Sections but for the application of this Section 9.3(b), exceeds $1,700,000 in the aggregate.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, except in the event of fraud, recourse by the Parent Indemnitees to the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the indemnification provisions contained in this Section 9 shall be the Parent Indemnitees’ sole and exclusive remedy after the Effective Time for monetary Damages for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the Company set forth in this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 9.3(c) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the rights of any Parent Indemnitee to seek or obtain injunctive relief or any other non-monetary equitable remedy to which such Parent Indemnitee is otherwise entitled.
(d) Except in the event of fraud or for the breach by Parent of any obligation to pay any amounts required to be paid pursuant to Sections 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8, the maximum aggregate amount payable by Parent to the Company Indemnitees pursuant to this Section 9 shall in no event exceed $20,000,000.
(e) Except in the event of fraud or for the breach by Parent of any obligation to pay any amounts required to be paid pursuant to Sections 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8, the indemnification provisions contained in this Section 9 shall be the Company Indemnitees’ sole and exclusive remedy after the Effective Time for monetary damages for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Parent set forth in this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 9.3(e) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the rights of any Company Indemnitee to seek or obtain injunctive relief or any other non-monetary equitable remedy to which such Company Indemnitee is otherwise entitled.
Without limiting the foregoing, in any case where an Indemnitor is defending a Legal Proceeding in accordance with Section 9.5, such Indemnitor shall be required to promptly inform the Indemnitee in writing of any definitive offer from a third-party claimant to settle in any respect such Legal Proceeding.
(h) In no event shall any Parent Indemnitee be entitled to be indemnified for a breach of the representation set forth in Section 2.25 or for the representation set forth in Section 2.4(c) (or in any certificate delivered at Closing, but only to the extent that it relates to such Sections) or the covenant set forth in Section 4.1(e), except to the extent that Parent’s Damages arise out of one or more Legal Proceedings brought by a stockholder or stockholders of Parent on the basis of such actual or alleged breach of representations set forth in Section 2.4(c) or Section 2.25.
(i) In the event Damages are directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any of the Parent Indemnitees or to which any of the Parent Indemnitees may otherwise become directly or indirectly subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third party claim), to the extent such Damages arise from or as a result of, or are directly or indirectly connected with an Acquired Company’s failure, prior to the Closing, to have complied with provisions in (1) Acquired Company Contracts with customers of the Acquired Companies specifying wafer yield, delivery date and capacity guarantee requirements or (2) Acquired Company Contracts with suppliers of the Acquired Companies specifying payment due date requirements, then:
(i) if such Damages are less than $25,000 with respect to any event or occurrence or series of related events or occurrences relating to the same customer or supplier, such Damages shall be deemed to be zero for all purposes under this Agreement;
(ii) if such Damages are greater than $25,000 but less than $275,000 with respect to any event or occurrence or series of related events or occurrences relating to the same customer or supplier, the amount of such Damages shall for all purposes of this Agreement be deemed to be 45% of the amount of such Damages; and
(j) The amount of “Damages” for which any Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be reduced by (i) with respect to Parent Indemnitees an amount (the “Net Alternative Recovery Amount”) equal to, (x) any portion of such Damages which such Parent Indemnitee has actually recovered against an insurance policy, net of any increase in premiums resulting from any such insurance claim and all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses relating to the recovery of such amounts to the extent not reimbursed by insurance, (y) any portion of such Damages which such Parent Indemnitee has actually recovered as a result of any indemnity claim by such Parent Indemnitee against Conexant or any licensor or transferor of Intellectual Property to the Company or (z) any portion of such Damages which such Parent Indemnitee has actually recovered from any supplier to the Company (any party referred to in clauses (x), (y) or (z) shall collectively be referred to as, “Specified Third Parties”), in each case with respect to the same facts and circumstances that give rise to the breach of representation and warranty, breach of covenant or other indemnifiable matter hereunder that has resulted in such Damages, (ii) the amount of any specific reserve or other specific accrual on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet (whenever established) that was specifically established to cover a particular item of Damages, up to the lesser of the amount of such Damages or the amount of such specific reserve or other accrual, but only to the extent that the establishment of such reserve or other accrual reduced the Final Closing Working Capital Amount, (iii) the amount of any general reserve or other general accrual on the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet established after the date of this Agreement, up to the lesser of the amount of Damages incurred by such Indemnitee with respect to the matter for which such reserve or accrual was established or the amount of such reserve or other accrual, but only to the extent that the establishment of such reserve or other accrual reduced the Final Closing Working Capital Amount; and (iv) the amount of any general reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable, up to the lesser of the amount of Damages from any inaccuracy in or breach of the representations and warranties in the last sentence of Section 2.7(b) or the amount of such general reserve.
No particular dollar of any reserve or other accrual shall be utilized more than once to offset a dollar of Damages.
With respect to clause (i) above, the applicable Parent Indemnitee(s) shall (contemporaneously with the pursuit by such Indemnitee(s) of indemnification claims hereunder), use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue claims against such insurance policies or Specified Third Parties, to the extent (x) such claims, if successful, would result in an offset pursuant to the terms of this Agreement against Damages that are otherwise indemnifiable hereunder, and (y) such claims are valid and reasonably recoverable based on a written insurance policy of which an Acquired Company is the beneficiary or the express terms of a written indemnity agreement between the Acquired Company and such Specified Third Party, a breach of contract by such Specified Third Party or as a result of the failure of any supplier to deliver any product that meets the specifications required by the Acquired Companies’ processes.
In no event shall the existence or pendency of any possible claim by an Indemnitee against any such insurance policy or Specified Third Party preclude any Indemnitee from delivering a Notice of Indemnification Claim with respect to any Damages that are directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by such Indemnitee or to which any of the Parent Indemnitees may otherwise become directly or indirectly subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third party claim), and that arise from or as a result of, or are directly or indirectly connected with, any matter described in Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(b), as applicable.
In the event that, with respect to clause (i) above, (1) an Indemnitee is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue a claim against an insurance policy or Specified Third Party, but (2) such Indemnitee has not recovered the Net Alternative Recovery Amount with respect to such claim prior to the time that such Indemnitee receives any payment out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund with respect to the particular breach of representation and warranty, breach of covenant or other indemnifiable matter hereunder to which such Net Alternative Recovery Amount would relate, such Indemnitee shall be obligated to continue to pursue such insurance claim or claim against such Specified Third Party for an additional period (A) of up to 120 days following the date of such Indemnitee’s receipt of such payment out of the Escrow Fund in the case of a Specified Third Party that is a supplier and (B) that is commercially reasonable under the circumstances in the case of any other Specified Third Party (any such additional period, the “Subsequent Pursuit Period”).
If, at any time on or prior to the Designated Date, such Indemnitee receives any Net Alternative Recovery Amount with respect to such insurance claim or claim against such Specified Third Party, such Indemnitee shall pay any portion of such Net Alternative Recovery Amount that would have reduced the amount of Damages recoverable by such Indemnitee from the Indemnity Escrow Fund back to the Indemnity Escrow Fund.
The payment of any such amount by Parent to the Stockholders’ Representative shall completely discharge Parent’s obligations with respect to such amount, and in no event shall Parent have any responsibility or liability whatsoever for causing or ensuring that all or any portion of such amount is ultimately paid or distributed to Escrow Participants.
9.4 No Contribution.
Each Stockholder waives, and acknowledges and agrees that such stockholder shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against Parent or against the Surviving Corporation or any of the other Acquired Companies in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to which such stockholder may become subject under or in connection with this Agreement.
9.5 Defense of Third Party Claims.
(a) In the event of the commencement by any Person of any Legal Proceeding (whether against a Parent Indemnitee, a Company Indemnitee or against any other Person) with respect to which any Indemnitee would reasonably be entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed pursuant to this Section 9, or the receipt by Parent of any written threat of such a Legal Proceeding: (i) the Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor promptly after the Indemnitee receives written notice of such actual or threatened Legal Proceeding (it being understood that any failure by the Indemnitee to so promptly notify the Indemnitor shall have no effect on the Indemnitee’s ability to recover Damages pursuant to this Section 9, except to the extent that the defense of such Legal Proceeding is materially prejudiced thereby); and (ii) if such Legal Proceeding does not involve any claims for any injunction, specific performance or any other non-monetary remedy or relief, the Indemnitor shall have the right, at its election, at any time prior to the end of the 90-day period commencing with the commencement of discovery proceedings in such Legal Proceeding, by delivering a written notice to the Indemnitee of such election, to proceed with the defense of such Legal Proceeding on its own with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee.
If the Indemnitor so proceeds with the defense of any such Legal Proceeding: (A) the Indemnitor shall be deemed to have conclusively agreed that all Damages suffered by the Indemnitee as a result of or in connection with the claim are recoverable from the Indemnitor under Section 9, subject to the provisions of Section 9.3; (B) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating to the defense of such Legal Proceeding shall be borne and paid exclusively by the Indemnitor (or in the case the Indemnitor is the Stockholders’ Representative, exclusively from the Indemnity Escrow Fund); (C) the Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to the Indemnitor reasonable access to properties, documents, materials and employees (subject to the execution of reasonable confidentiality agreements that permit such confidential information to be used in the legal proceedings) to the extent that the Indemnitor determines in good faith that such access is necessary to the defense of such Legal Proceeding; (D) the Indemnitee (which in the case the Indemnitor is Parent shall refer solely for this purpose to the Stockholders’ Representative) may, at its own cost and expense, participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such Legal Proceeding; and (E) the Indemnitor shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such Legal Proceeding with the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
In addition, the Indemnitor shall not have the right to assume the control of the defense of any such Legal Proceeding if at the time the Indemnitor assumes control the amount claimed in such Legal Proceeding, in the aggregate with the amount claimed in other third party claims and direct claims against the Indemnitor (or in the case the Indemnitor is the Stockholders’ Representative, the Indemnity Escrow Fund) asserted as of such time against the Indemnitor (or in the case the Indemnitor is the Stockholders’ Representative, the Indemnity Escrow Fund) under this Section 9, would exceed the limitation of the Indemnitor’s liability set forth in Section 9.3(c) or Section 9.3(d), as applicable.
(b) If, with respect to any Legal Proceeding described in Section 9.5(a), the Indemnitor is not permitted to proceed with the defense of such Legal Proceeding or is required to cease its control of such Legal Proceeding, or does not elect (or has not yet informed the Indemnitee in writing that it is electing) to proceed with the defense of any such Legal Proceeding, the Indemnitee may proceed with the defense of such Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitor.
If the Indemnitee so proceeds with the defense of any such Legal Proceeding: (i) if it is ultimately agreed or otherwise determined that the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification for Damages resulting from such Legal Proceeding pursuant to this Section 9, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses relating to the defense of such Legal Proceeding shall, subject to Section 9.3, be borne and paid exclusively by the Indemnitor (or in the case the Indemnitor is the Stockholders’ Representative, exclusively from the Indemnity Escrow Fund); (ii) the Indemnitor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to the Indemnitee any documents and materials that the Indemnitee determines in good faith may be necessary to the defense of such Legal Proceeding; (iii) the Indemnitor may, at its own cost and expense, participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such Legal Proceeding; and (iv) the Indemnitee shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such Legal Proceeding; provided, however, that if the Indemnitee settles, adjusts or compromises any such Legal Proceeding without the consent of the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee shall bear the burden of proof to establish the Damages arising as result of such Legal Proceeding for which the Indemnitee is entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed pursuant to this Section 9, and Damages paid in connection with settlement, adjustment or compromise of such Legal Proceeding shall not establish any presumption regarding the amount of such Damages or any liability of the Indemnitor with respect thereto.
At least five business days prior to any resolution, settlement or compromise of such claim that would result in a Parent Indemnitee being entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 9, Parent shall inform the Stockholders’ Representative of the terms of such resolution, settlement or compromise and shall consider the Stockholders’ Representative’s views regarding the advisability of resolving, settling or compromising such claim on the terms proposed.
Thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to resolve, settle or compromise such claim on the terms presented to the Stockholders’ Representative (or such additional terms as have been proposed by the Stockholders’ Representative), without the consent of the Stockholders’ Representative, provided, however, that if a Parent Indemnitee settles, adjusts or compromises any such claim without the consent of the Stockholders’ Representative, the Parent Indemnitee shall bear the burden of proof to establish the Damages arising as result of such claim for which the Indemnitee is entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated or reimbursed pursuant to this Section 9, and Damages paid in connection with resolution, settlement or compromise of such claim shall not establish any presumption regarding the amount of such Damages or any liability of the Indemnitor with respect thereto.
9.6 Exercise of Remedies by Parent Indemnitees Other Than Parent.
No Parent Indemnitee (other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.
9.7 Indemnification Claims; Escrow Arrangements.
Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not agreed by the Indemnitor to be owed to the Indemnitee pursuant to the Response Notice (or the entire Claimed Amount, if the Indemnitor asserts in the Response Notice that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee) shall be referred to as the “Contested Amount” (it being understood that the Contested Amount shall be modified from time to time to reflect any good faith modifications by the Indemnitee to the Claimed Amount).
During the Dispute Period, the Indemnitee and its Affiliates shall cooperate with the Indemnitor to permit it to investigate such claim, including by providing the Indemnitor and its representatives reasonable access to the books, records, properties and employees of Indemnitor to the extent reasonably related to the investigation of such claim.
Within three days after the execution of such settlement agreement:
Arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator, mutually selected by the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor; provided, however, that if the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor fail to mutually select an arbitrator within 15 business days after the contested portion of the indemnification claim is submitted to arbitration, then the arbitrator shall be selected by JAMS in accordance with its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect.
The parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the arbitration hearing to be conducted within 75 days after the appointment of the arbitrator, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the decision of the arbitrator to be furnished within 15 days after the conclusion of the arbitration hearing.
The arbitrator’s authority shall be confined to: (i) whether the Indemnitee is entitled to recover the Contested Amount (or a portion thereof), and the portion of the Contested Amount the Indemnitee is entitled to recover; and (ii) whether either party to the arbitration shall be required to bear and pay all or a portion of the other party’s attorneys’ fees and other expenses relating to the arbitration.
(k) All cash released to Escrow Participants pursuant to this Section 9.7 will be deemed to have been released in full satisfaction of the rights of such Escrow Participants under Sections 1.5(a)(ii)(E), 1.5(a)(iii)(E) and 1.6(a)(v), as the case may be.
(l) The parties agree that any cash released from the Working Capital Adjustment Escrow Fund and/or the Indemnity Escrow Fund to any Parent Indemnitee pursuant to Section 1.7 or this Section 9 shall, to the extent permitted pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, be treated as a reduction in the Aggregate Closing Transaction Value for federal income tax purposes.
9.8 Tax Matters.
(a) The parties shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods or relating to Taxes, including maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in connection with Taxes of the Acquired Companies.
Except to the extent otherwise required by law, such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the past practices of such entities.
With respect to any Tax Return for a Straddle Period, Parent and the Acquired Companies shall apportion Taxes to the Interim Period in accordance with Section 1.7(f)(ii) hereof.
The Stockholders’ Representative shall have the right to review and comment on the Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date.
In the event the Parent rejects any such comments by the Stockholders’ Representative on any such Tax Return, and Parent and the Stockholders’ Representative cannot within a reasonable period of time resolve such disagreement, such Tax Return shall be filed as proposed by the Stockholders’ Representative (to the extent its comments relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date), and the parties shall submit to binding arbitration in the State of California in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect the issue of whether the position embodied in the change to the Tax Return requested by the Stockholders’ Representative and rejected by Parent is more consistent with applicable Tax law than the position of the Parent sought to be changed.
For the avoidance of doubt, the authority of the Arbitrator shall be limited to the determination of whether the position embodied in the change to the Tax Return requested by the Stockholders’ Representative and rejected by Parent is more consistent with applicable Tax law than the position of the Parent sought to be changed.
Arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator, mutually selected by the Stockholders’ Representative and the Parent; provided, however, that if they fail to mutually select an arbitrator within 15 business days after the contested portion of the indemnification claim is submitted to arbitration, then the arbitrator shall be selected by JAMS in accordance with its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures then in effect.
The parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the arbitration hearing to be conducted within 75 days after the appointment of the arbitrator, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the decision of the arbitrator to be furnished within 15 days after the conclusion of the arbitration hearing.
The final decision of the arbitrator shall constitute a conclusive determination of the issues in question, binding upon the Stockholders Representative and Parent and its Affiliates.
If the final decision of the Arbitrator is in favor of Parent, Parent may at its election cause to be filed an amended Tax Return that embodies the position of Parent.
(c) Parent and the Acquired Companies may amend any Tax Return filed with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, provided that no Parent Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder arising out of or in connection with the filing of any such amended Tax Return unless the filing of such amendment is required by a Governmental Body as a result of an audit or is clearly required by applicable Legal Requirements.
The payment of any such amount by Parent to the Stockholders’ Representative shall completely discharge Parent’s obligations with respect to such amount, and in no event shall Parent have any responsibility or liability whatsoever for causing or ensuring that all or any portion of such amount is ultimately paid or distributed to Escrow Participants.
Parent and the Stockholders’ Representative shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim.
The Stockholders’ Representative shall have the right to control the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim with respect to which Parent Indemnitees would be entitled to indemnity under Section 9.2 hereof; provided that (i) the Stockholders’ Representative shall keep Parent informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of any Tax Contest Claim, including providing Parent with all written materials relating to such Tax proceeding received from the relevant Governmental Body, (ii) Parent shall be entitled to participate in any Tax Contest Claim at its own expense, including having an opportunity to comment on any written materials prepared in connection with any Tax Contest Claim and to attend any conferences relating to any Tax Contest Claim and (iii) the Stockholders’ Representative shall not compromise or settle any such Tax Contest Claim without obtaining Parent’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
If the Stockholders’ Representative requests in writing the consent of the Parent to a proposed settlement of a Tax Contest Claim embodied in a written settlement offer from the applicable Governmental Body (a “Proposed Settlement”) and Parent withholds or conditions its consent, or delays its consent for more than 15 business days, in each case to such Proposed Settlement, thereafter the Stockholders’ Representative shall no longer be obligated to continue to defend or prosecute its position with respect to the issues in such Tax Contest Claim that are covered by the Proposed Settlement, and the maximum liability for indemnity that may be claimed and recovered by the Parent Indemnitees in respect of any claim for indemnity arising from or as a result of, or are directly or indirectly connected with the issues in such Tax Contest Claim as are proposed to be settled in the Proposed Settlement, shall be limited to the amount required to be paid under the Proposed Settlement.
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount of Taxes at risk from an adverse determination of the items in dispute in the Tax Contest Claim with respect to the Pre-Closing Period is less than the amount of Taxes at risk from an adverse determination of such items with respect to any Post-Closing Period, then Parent shall have the right to control the conduct of the Tax Contest Claim, provided that (i) Parent shall keep the Stockholders’ Representative informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Contest Claim, including providing the Stockholders’ Representative with all written materials relating to such Tax proceeding received from the relevant Governmental Body, (ii) the Stockholders’ Representative shall be entitled to participate in such Tax Contest Claim at its own expense or the expense of the Escrow Participants, including having an opportunity to comment on any written materials prepared in connection with such Tax Contest Claim and to attend any conferences relating to such Tax Contest Claim and (iii) Parent shall not compromise or settle any Tax Contest Claim without obtaining the Stockholders’ Representative’s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.
(g) In addition, the Stockholder Representative shall not have the right to assume the control of any Tax Contest Claim if, at the time the Stockholder Representative assumes control the amount claimed at issue in such Tax Contest Claim, in the aggregate with the amount claimed in other third party claims and direct claims against the Indemnity Escrow Fund under this Section 9, would exceed the limitation of liability set forth in Section 9.3(c).
(h) The Acquired Companies may make (or cause to be made) an election under Section 172(b)(3) of the Code (or any analogous or similar rules in any relevant tax jurisdiction, to the extent permitted by law) to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to any net operating loss attributable to the Acquired Companies in any Post-Closing Tax Period that could be carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.
(i) In the event any provision of this Section 9.8 conflicts with another provision in this Section 9, this Section 9.8 shall control.
(a) The Escrow Participants (by virtue of the approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement) hereby irrevocably nominate, constitute and appoint TC Group, L.L.C.
